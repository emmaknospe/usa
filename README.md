# USA
USA (Untitled Scholarship Application) was developed by Will Knospe as the web application behind MyScholar, 
a scholarship platform created by Will Knospe, Erik Hansen and Elvin Ng as a submission to Carleton College's 
Entrepreneurship Competition. USA supports the creation, search, and viewing of scholarships as well as 
including a dynamic application process creation interface that allows donors to customize the process
behind applying to their scholarship, including options for essays, short answer, multiple choice, and file 
submission questions.
